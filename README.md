# Assignment 2 - Android App Development

An Android application that covers API integration, user interface design, and Android development best practices.
Three main screens: Login, Dashboard, and Details. The app will interact with the 'vu-nit3213-api' to authenticate the user and retrieve data.

## Installation

1. Download the [zip file](https://github.com/emiliell/Assignment2) from github.
2. Unzip the file and create a new project on Android Studio by importing the file.

## Executing program

#### Before running
1. Wait until gradle has been properly synced. This process may take some time.
2. Go to the Device Manager on the toolbar on the right-hand side to add a new device if none were added previously.

#### Running the app
1. To run the app, press the 'run app' button at the top.
2. The login screen should be displayed in the emulator when the app is done compiling.
3. To login, use the credentials below:
- Username: emilie
- Password: 8074381
- Campus: footscray

(Note: If the first time login was unsuccessful even with the right credentials, the api might be dormant. Wait 1-2 minutes before trying again)

4. Upon successful login, the dashboard screen is displayed. Use the 'show data' button to navigate to the details screen
5. Use the 'back' button at the top of the emulator to go back to the dashboard.
